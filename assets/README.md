This folder contains the resources for the project, such as images, shaders, etc.

## Credits
The implementation for the geometric shaders was borrowed from [OpenGL-TileMap-Demos](https://github.com/davudk/OpenGL-TileMap-Demos) by davudk

The design for the original_atlas.kra was inspired by the original Microsoft game.
